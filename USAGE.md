## Signal Flow Tips

### Where to Place OneKnob

1. **Individual Tracks** - After EQ, before reverb sends
2. **Buses** - Last in the chain before the master
3. **Mix Bus** - After bus processing, before limiter

### A/B Testing

Use the center (0%) position to quickly bypass and compare:
1. Dial in your setting
2. Return to center to hear the difference
3. Adjust to taste
